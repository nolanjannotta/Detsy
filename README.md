The problem: 
Alice is an artist and likes to make physical, artistic and functional objects. She makes things like furniture, sculptures, household objects, wearable things like clothes, jewelry etc. She also a huge proponent of web3 and crypto, and she believes its the future of commerce, finance etc. 
Alice sells some of her work online on her own website and sites like ebay and etsy. On those sites however, she is only able to sell her items for fiat currency. Alice wants to start earning crypto currency for her work, how can she do that? 

The solution: 
Smart contract(s). Soon she will be able to deploy a smart contract that she owns to handle all business logic. she can list collections of items or one of one items for sale on her new web3 website. she will be able to specify the parameters of a built in referral and discount program. private information like Shipping addresses may be handles using the XMTP protocol or the Lit protocol (or a different solution). 
More details to come...
